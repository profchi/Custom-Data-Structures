# Custom-Data-Structures
Manually implement some Known data Structures in c++.

# Custom Stack
This is an implementation of a Generic Stack class. Elements added last goto the top of the Stack and can be retrieved first. It contains the following methods:

Push(element) - Adds an object Element to the top of the Stack.
Pop() - Removes an element from the top of the Stack and returns it.
Peek() - Returns the element at the top of the stack without removing it.
ToArray() - Returns a pointer to the first element of an array of all the elements on the Stack starting with the top element.
Size() - Returns the number of elements in the Stack.
IsEmpty() - Returns true if stack is empty, otherwise returns false.

# Custom Queue
This implements a Generic Queue class. Elements added go to the back of theof the queue. The element added most recently would be retrieve last while the first element to be added among the list of elements would be retrieve first. It also contains similar methods:

Push(element) - Adds an object Element to the back of the Queue.
Pop() - Removes an element from the front of the Queue and returns it.
Peek() - Returns the element at the front of the Queue without removing it.
ToArray() - Returns a pointer to the first element of an array of all the elements on the Queue starting with the first element.
Size() - Returns the number of elements in the Queue.
IsEmpty() - Returns true if queue is empty, otherwise returns false.
